**A02:2021 â€“ Cryptographic Failures**
**Overview:**
\- Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, this category focuses on failures related to cryptography, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
\- Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) include Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259), Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327), and Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331).
**Description:**
\- It's essential to assess the protection needs of data in transit and at rest, especially for sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and health records.
\- Various checks should be performed to ensure secure transmission and storage of data, including encryption enforcement, validation of server certificates, proper key management, and avoidance of deprecated cryptographic functions.
**Prevention Measures:**
\- Classify sensitive data and avoid storing it unnecessarily. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong algorithms and protocols.
\- Implement proper key management, enforce encryption, disable caching for sensitive data responses, and use secure hashing functions for password storage.
\- Ensure appropriate initialization vectors, use authenticated encryption, and generate cryptographic keys randomly.
\- Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and padding schemes, and independently verify the effectiveness of security configurations.
**Example Attack Scenarios:**
\- SQL injection flaw exploiting automatic database decryption, interception of session cookies through insecure connections, and exposure of unsalted password hashes through file upload flaws.
**References:**
\- OWASP resources on proactive controls, application security verification, transport layer protection, user privacy protection, password storage, cryptographic storage, and testing for weak cryptography offer further guidance and best practices.
